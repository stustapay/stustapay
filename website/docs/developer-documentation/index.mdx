# Developer Documentation

To get started with development first clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/stustapay/stustapay.git
```

## Developing on your local machine

Install system requirements:
- `python >= 3.11`
- `nodejs >= 18`
- `docker` (optional, recommended for running postgresql in a docker container)

### Setup Backend for Development
Create a python virtualenv 
```shell
python3 -m virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install backend python module as a local editable python module. 
This will install all python requirements needed for development and testing as well.
```shell
pip install -e '.[dev,test]'
```

You should now have the `stustapay` command available.

#### Setup the database

Start a local postgres instance via docker compose.

```shell
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.devel.yaml up
```
This will start a postgresql instance and bind it to the local port `5433` 
(to not conflict with already locally running postgres databases on the default port.)

<details>
<summary>Use an already running local postgresql instance</summary>
<div>
Another option is to run a local postgresql instance.

In that case you have to take care of setting up a database user and database yourself.
You'll probably want to copy `etc/config.devel.yaml` and adapt the database connection settings.

</details>

Apply the database schema
```shell
stustapay -c etc/config.devel.yaml db migrate
```

Now you're mostly set up and ready to start developing and using the backend.

Head over to the [simulator docs](simulator.md) to see how to generate test data and obtain a somewhat realistic test setup.

### Setup web frontend for development

To install the web ui requirements run
```shell
cd web
npm install
```

### Running
To start the administration web and customer web interfaces in development mode (supports live code reloading) run

```shell
npx nx serve administration
npx nx serve customerportal
```

Other usefull commands for development (where `project` is either `customerportal` or `administration`) are
```shell
npx nx build <project>
npx nx lint <project>
```

## Developing in a devcontainer

You can use vscode's [development containers](https://containers.dev/),
we've included a configuration file in the repo root.

After starting the devcontainer you can simply start up the core services and the web uis.

When using DevContainer make sure to forward the port globally. Otherwise the till will not be able to connect.
In the VSCode Settings set Remote: Local Port Host to `allInterfaces`

Troubles with the database?
Connect to the database in the devcontainer pstgres-data (below dev volumes), then drop and re-create the schema.

1. `su - postgres -c psql`
2. `drop schema public cascade;`
3. `create schema public;`
