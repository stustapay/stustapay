If you're a first-time committer, add yourself to the above list. This is not
just for legal reasons, but also to keep an overview of all those nicknames.

If your info is missing, wrong, or you want it to be removed for whatever
reason, please contact us.

A full list of all StuStaPay authors ("contributors") can also be determined
from the VCS, e.g. via `git shortlog -sne`, or conveniently looked up on
[the GitHub web interface](https://github.com/stustapay/stustapay/graphs/contributors).

Details on individual authorships of files can be obtained via the VCS,
e.g. via `git blame`, or the GitHub web interface.

If you wish to include a file from StuStaPay in your project, make sure to
include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`authors.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.
